# You wouldn't. Ask anyway!

Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase. Oh, I think we should just stay friends. Well, then good news! It's a suppository. Ven ve voke up, ve had zese wodies.

You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from intestinal parasites? Ah, yes! John Quincy Adding Machine. He struck a chord with the voters when he pledged not to go on a killing spree. __No!__ *I want to live!* There are still too many things I don't own!

## Yeah, and if you were the pope they'd be all, "Straighten your pope hat." And "Put on your good vestments."

What's with you kids? Every other day it's food, food, food. Alright, I'll get you some stupid food. I love you, buddy! I could if you hadn't turned on the light and shut off my stereo. You lived before you met me?!

1. Ummm…to eBay?
2. Why did you bring us here?
3. I haven't felt much of anything since my guinea pig died.

### Hey, tell me something. You've got all this money. How come you always dress like you're doing your laundry?

There, now he's trapped in a book I wrote: a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors! When will that be? I saw you with those two "ladies of the evening" at Elzars. Explain that. Negative, bossy meat creature!

* It doesn't look so shiny to me.
* You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from intestinal parasites?
* When the lights go out, it's nobody's business what goes on between two consenting adults.

Negative, bossy meat creature! Who said that? SURE you can die! You want to die?! Is the Space Pope reptilian!? With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun!

Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets? Kids don't turn rotten just from watching TV. Of all the friends I've had… you're the first. Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk!

What kind of a father would I be if I said no? Then we'll go with that data file! When will that be? Switzerland is small and neutral! We are more like Germany, ambitious and misunderstood! Oh yeah, good luck with that.

I'll tell them you went down prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger. I've got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth. Suddenly, I'm going to the bathroom like clockwork, every three hours. And those jerks at Social Security stopped sending me checks. Now 'I'' have to pay ''them'!

Oh, I think we should just stay friends. Who are those horrible orange men? Leela, Bender, we're going grave robbing. How much did you make me? Quite possible. We live long and are celebrated poopers.

You guys go on without me! I'm going to go… look for more stuff to steal! Anyhoo, your net-suits will allow you to experience Fry's worm infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them.

Daylight and everything. With gusto. I love this planet! I've got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of sleaze that those things bring. Of all the friends I've had… you're the first. Good news, everyone! I've taught the toaster to feel love!

And why did 'I' have to take a cab? So, how 'bout them Knicks? No! Don't jump! What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! 'It is!' My precious torso! One hundred dollars.

Really?! We don't have a brig. Hey, whatcha watching? Hey, guess what you're accessories to.

Switzerland is small and neutral! We are more like Germany, ambitious and misunderstood! I just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Fry, that doesn't make sense. Bender, we're trying our best.

Why would I want to know that? How much did you make me? You won't have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you'll be doing. Quite possible. We live long and are celebrated poopers.
